# Chatbot Deployment with Flask and JavaScript

![image](https://github.com/prashiljatakiya/NLP-chatbot/assets/92420541/3d60b5e8-09bf-4779-b90a-0287b6b0b39d)

This gives 2 deployment options:
- Deploy within Flask app with jinja2 template
- Serve only the Flask prediction API. The used html and javascript files can be included in any Frontend application (with only a slight modification) and can run completely separate from the Flask App then.

## Initial Setup:
This repo currently contains the starter files.

Clone repo and create a virtual environment
```
$ git clone https://github.com/prashiljatakiya/NLP-chatbot.git
```
Install dependencies
```
$ (venv) pip install Flask torch torchvision nltk
```
Install nltk package
```
$ (venv) python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```
Modify `intents.json` with different intents and responses for your Chatbot

Run
```
$ (venv) python train.py
```
This will dump data.pth file. And then run
the following command to test it in the console.
```
$ (venv) python chat.py
```
